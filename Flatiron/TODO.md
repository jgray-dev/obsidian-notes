i want to do nights and weekends to build shit. i struggle being creative and making the ideas, but when something pops into my head i become strangely obsessed with seeing it through, and i think n&w will be the motivating factor to get me there. its also a big motivation thing for me, the entire reason i moved 2000 miles to Denver for a bootcamp is because its in person. i struggle to stay motivated outside of scheduled times unless I have a project im passionate about,  i think nights and weekends will get me to that motivated and passionate phase, and also be a fun experience where i can push myself further than i have been, and build cool shit

### build shit
