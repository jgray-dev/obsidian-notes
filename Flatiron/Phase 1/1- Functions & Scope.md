**Const and Let:** `const` declares a constant variable whose value cannot be changed. `let` declares a variable whose value can be changed.

```
const x = 10; 
let y = 20; 
y = 30;
```

**Functions:** Regular functions are defined with the `function` keyword. Arrow functions are a more concise syntax.

`function add(a, b) { return a + b; }`

`const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;`

**Scopes:** Variables declared outside any function or block are global. Variables declared inside a function or block are local to that scope.
