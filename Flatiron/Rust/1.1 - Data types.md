Data types:

In Rust, integers can be signed or unsigned. Signed integers start with `i` and unsigned integers start with `u` The number following `i` or `u` is the number of bits the integer takes up. For example, `i32` is a 32-bit signed integer and `u64` is a 64-bit unsigned integer.

#### Signed integers
Signed integers can represent positive or negative values.
Half the bit size is dedicated to each positive or negative values.
Example:
`i8` represents values `-128 -> 127`

#### Unsigned Integers
Unsigned integers can represent only positive values. 
The entire bit size is dedicated to positive numbers
`u8` represents values `0 -> 255`







## Listing Data types

`i8` - signed 8-bit integer 
`i16` - signed 16-bit integer 
`i32` - signed 32-bit integer 
`i64` - signed 64-bit integer
`i128` - signed 128-bit integer 
`isize` - signed pointer-sized integer

`u8` - unsigned 8-bit integer 
`u16` - unsigned 16-bit integer 
`u32` - unsigned 32-bit integer 
`u64` - unsigned 64-bit integer 
`u128` - unsigned 128-bit integer 
`usize` - unsigned pointer-sized integer

`f32` - 32-bit floating-point 
`f64` - 64-bit floating-point

`bool` - `boolean` type (true or false)

`char` - single Unicode scalar value

`[T; N]` - fixed-size array of type T with length N 
`&[T]` - shared slice of type T 
`&mut [T]` - mutable slice of type T

`(T1, T2, ..., Tn)` - tuple with elements of different types

`struct` - user-defined type grouping related data fields

`enum` - user-defined type representing a fixed set of possible values

`&T` - shared reference to type T &mut T - mutable reference to type T

`*const T` - raw pointer to read-only data of type 
`T *mut T` - raw pointer to mutable data of type T

`fn(T1, T2, ..., Tn) -> R` - function type with parameter types T and return type R

`!` - never type representing a computation that never completes

`()` - unit type representing an empty tuple



#### Compound types
`tuple` is similar to an array, but it holds different data types. They have a fixed length, so cannot be appended to, or removed from after declaration

```
let example_tuple = ("this is >example_tuple.1<", 500, 0.3)

println!("{}", example_tuple.1)
```

`array` is just an array
